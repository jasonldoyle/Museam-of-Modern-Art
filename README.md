### Description

In this project, I explored two datasets focusing on the artists and artworks featured in the Museum of Modern Art. Using this data, I built an interactive dashboard to provide insights into various aspects of the museum’s collection and history.

The dashboard has three tabs:
1) An overview of the **Museum’s** acquisition patterns over time.
2) A breakdown of the **Artists** whose works are featured in the museum.
3) An exploration of popular artworks, mediums, and trends across different **Decades**.

The project has a notebook with Dash, a JupyterDash version for inline viewing, and a standalone app using Python scripts. For easier access, I included screenshots of the dashboard at the bottom of this ReadMe, along with links to my Kaggle notebook (Inline notebook) and additional details about the datasets and tech stack.
